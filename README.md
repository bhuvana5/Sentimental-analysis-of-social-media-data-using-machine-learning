# Sentimental-analysis-of-social-media-data-using-machine-learning
# Aim is to build sentimental analyzer using machine learning model for social media data.
# Twitter and you tube is taken as social media and datasets were collected.
# Implemented Reccurant neural network, support vector machine, logistic regression to check which model classifies data most accurately.
# For twitter data reccurant neural network is best sentimental analyzer.
# for you tube data support vector machine is best model.
# datas were collected from web and dataworld.com
